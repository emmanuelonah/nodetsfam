<h1 align="left" style="font-size:40px;">NodeTsFam NodeJs Framework</h1>

# Description ðŸ“¦

<p style="font-size:11px;">NodeTsFam is an acronym for <span style="color:green">NodeJs Typescript Framework</span></p>

The "NodeTsFem" project provides a custom setup for Node.js development, designed to make it easy for developers to bootstrap a new project. It uses TypeScript for static typing and includes pre-configured tools and scripts for building, testing, and running the application.

This project aims to reduce the time and effort required to start a new Node.js project by providing a ready-to-use environment that follows current best practices. It's perfect for developers who want to focus on writing their application code, without having to worry about setting up the development environment from scratch.

Whether you're a seasoned Node.js developer or just getting started, "NodeTsFem" can help you kickstart your next project quickly and efficiently.
